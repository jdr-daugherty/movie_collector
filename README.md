# Movie Collector Test Project

Spring and TDD practice.

## TODO List
- Change PUT and POST handlers to use @RequestParam for inputs instead of DTOs
- Use @RequestBody for review body
- Details (/details) that combines Movie, Review, and TMDB details
- Search (/search) to find movies in TMDB
- Oauth2 authentication via Google Cloud
- Users with reviews and movies stored by user.
- Consider WireMock for testing TMDB interface.
